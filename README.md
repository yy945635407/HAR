Human Activity Recognition through CNN-LSTM network with a C/S architecture

This is my undergraduate graduation design, which is a system which uses the sensors's data from user's android phone to predict what kind of activity the user is taking. In this project there are six kinds of activities: walking, standing, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting and lying down.

The Android folder includes a .apk file for android installation and the Android Studio project of the Client part of this system, while the Python file contains the server part of this system and some ohter files
